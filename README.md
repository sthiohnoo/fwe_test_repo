# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to
structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks
to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are
suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long
is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather
than cutting out information.

## Name

Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be
unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your
project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges

On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the
project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see
GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation / Getting started

_Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew.
However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing
specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a
specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be
installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection._

### Step 0: Prerequisites

Ensure the following software components are installed on your PC:

- [ ] Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment)
- [ ] npm (Node Package Manager)
- [ ] Git
- [ ] Docker and Docker Compose

1. Install __Node.js__ and __npm__

   Visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
   Download the recommended version for your platform (LTS version is recommended).
   Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
   Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

2. Install __Git__

   Visit the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/).
   Download the recommended version for your platform.
   Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
   Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

3. Install __Docker__ and __Docker Compose__

   Visit the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/).
   Download the recommended version for your platform.
   Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
   Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    docker --version
    docker-compose --version
    ```

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://code.fbi.h-da.de/sthiohnoo/fwe-ws-24-25-1120617.git
cd fwe-ws-24-25-1120617
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

# TODO: Ab hier muss alles in backend-Ordner gemacht werden. Sollte ich das Projekt aufsetzten in fornt- und backend trennen?

Install the necessary dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

To configure the application to use the database in Docker, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env` file in the src directory and copy the `.env.example` file content into it.
2. Edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholders(user, password, database) with the actual values from
   `docker-compose.yml`

### Step 4: Set Up the Database

Set up the database using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 5: Migrate the Database

Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

### Step 6: Start the Application

Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

## Application Functionalities

### Main Functionalities

- __Manage Shopping Lists__: Create, read, update, and delete shopping lists.
- __Manage Items__: Create, read, update, and delete items in the shopping list.

### Additional Functionalities

- __Database Connection__: Connects to a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve data.
- __Health Check__: Checks the status of the application.

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of
usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably
include in the README.

## Support

Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address,
etc.

## Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing

State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started.
Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps
explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce
the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially
helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment

Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License

For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status

If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has
slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or
owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
